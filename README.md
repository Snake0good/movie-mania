## How it's made. 

**Tech Used**: React, Tailwind, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB - MERN + Tailwind
I really dug into React and Tailwin initially to build out the original movie app. After the first day, I was really suprised at how easy and fun it was to build with this technology and I wanted to extend my learning to the full-stack. It took longer to complete the project than expected, but I'm satisfied with everything that is live. 

## Optimizations
In the future, it would be nice to optimize a few things
- increase overall speed on clicks and loads
- include user preferences with more MongoDB backend
- add additional search features
- take the preferences of the user and use that to build recommendations 


## Lessons Learned
Since this was my first full-stack app I had to learn a lot about connecting to frontend with the backend. MongoDB became much more clear and now I feel confident using Node.js and Express.js to connect to MongoDB. Using fetch and axios took some time to get used to. Something that I am proud of is learning how to do a smooth login and signup form. I was really excited about everything coming together and being able to login new users with their own selections.
